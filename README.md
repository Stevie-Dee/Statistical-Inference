# Statistical-Inference
This is the project for the statistical inference class. In it, you will use simulation to explore inference and do some simple inferential data analysis. The project consists of two parts:

1. A simulation exercise.
2. Basic inferential data analysis.

You will create a report to answer the questions. Given the nature of the series, ideally you'll use knitr to create the reports and convert to a pdf.
